"TheOpening_Text" = "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Praise belongs to God, Lord of all Worlds, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgement. It is you we worship; it is you we ask for help. Guide us to the straight path, the path of those you have blessed, those who incur no anger and who have not gone astray.\n\n[Chapter 1, Verses 1-7]";

"Quran" = "Quran";
"Quran_Text" = "This is the Book in which there is no doubt, containing guidance for those who are mindful of God, who believe in the unseen, keep up the prayer, and give out of what We have provided for them; those who believe in the revelation sent down to you [Muhammad], and in what was sent before you, those who have firm faith in the Hereafter. Such people are following their Lord’s guidance and it is they who will prosper.\n\n[Chapter 2, Verses 2-5]";

"ClingingSubstance" = "Clinging Substance";
"ClingingSubstance_Text" = "Read in the name of your Lord who created - created human beings from a clinging substance. Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous - Who taught by the pen – He taught human beings what they didn’t know before.\n\n[Chapter 96, Verses 1-5]";

"MorningBrightness" = "Morning Brightness";
"MorningBrightness_Text" = "By the sun in its morning brightness and by the moon as it follows it, by the day as it displays the sun’s glory and by the night as it conceals it, by the sky and how He built it and by the earth and how He spread it, and by the soul and its balanced (nature) and its innate awareness (of right and wrong). The one who purifies his soul succeeds and the one who corrupts it fails.\n\n[Chapter 91, Verses 1-10]";

"God" = "God";
"God_Text" = "Say, He is God the One, God the eternal. He does not give birth nor was he born and there is nothing like him.\n\n[Chapter 112, Verses 1-4]";

"Balance" = "Balance";
"Balance_Text" = "It is the Lord of mercy who taught the Quran, He created the human being and taught him to communicate. The sun and the moon follow their calculated courses, the plants and the trees submit to his designs; and the heaven He raised and imposed the balance so that you may not exceed in the balance. Weigh with justice and do not fall short in the balance. He set down the earth for his creatures with its fruits, its palm trees and sheathed clusters, its husked grain, its fragrant plants, so which of your Lord’s favours will you deny?\n\n[Chapter 55, Verses 1-13]";

"Nature" = "Nature";
"Nature_Text" = "It is God who splits open the seed and the fruit stone: He brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living – that is God – so how can you turn away from the truth? He makes the dawn break; He makes the night for rest; and He made the sun and the moon to a precise measure. That is the design of the Almighty, the All Knowing. It is He who made the stars, so that they can guide you when land and sea are dark: We have made the signs clear for those who have knowledge. It is He who first produced you from a single soul, then gave you a place to stay [in life] and a resting place [after death]. We have made Our revelations clear to those who understand. It is He who sends down water from the sky. With it We produce the shoots of each plant, then bring greenery from it, and from that We bring out grains, one riding on the other in close - packed rows. From the date palm come clusters of low-hanging dates, and there are gardens of vines, olives, and pomegranates, alike yet different. Watch their fruits as they grow and ripen! In all this there are signs for those who would believe.\n\n[Chapter 6, Verses 95-99]";

"SignsOfGod" = "Signs Of God";
"SignsOfGod_Text" = "So celebrate God’s glory in the evening, in the morning, praise is due to Him in the heavens and the earth, in the late afternoon, and at midday. He brings the living out of the dead and the dead out of the living. He gives life to the earth after death, and you will be brought out in the same way. One of His signs is that He created you from dust and – lo and behold! – you became human and scattered far and wide. Another of His signs is that He created spouses from among yourselves for you to live with in tranquillity: He ordained love and kindness between you. There truly are signs in this for those who reflect. Another of His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth, and the diversity of your languages and colours. There truly are signs in this for those who know. Among His signs are your sleep, by night and by day, and your seeking His bounty. There are signs in this for those who listen. Among His signs, too, are that He shows you the lightning that terrifies and inspires hope; that He sends water down from the sky to restore the earth to life after death. There truly are signs in this for those who use their reason. Among His signs, too, is the fact that the heavens and the earth stand firm by His command. In the end, you will all emerge when He calls you from the earth. Everyone in the heavens and earth belongs to Him, and all are obedient to Him. He is the One who originates creation and will do it again – this is even easier for Him. He is above all comparison in the heavens and earth; He is the Almighty, the All Wise.\n\n[Chapter 30, Verses 17-27]";

"Purpose" = "Purpose";
"Purpose_Text" = "[He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving - [and] who created seven heavens in layers. You do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return [your] vision [to the sky]; do you see any breaks? Then return [your] vision twice again. [Your] vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued. And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars\n\n[Chapter 67, Verses 2-5]";

"Reflection" = "Reflection";
"Reflection_Text" = "Your Lord is God, who created the heavens and earth in six stages, then established Himself on the throne; He makes the night cover the day in swift pursuit; He created the sun, moon, and stars to be subservient to His command; all creation and command belong to Him. Exalted be God, Lord of all the worlds! Call on your Lord humbly and privately – He does not like those who transgress His bounds: do not corrupt the earth after it has been set right – call on Him fearing and hoping. The mercy of God is close to those who do good. It is God who sends the winds, bearing good news of His coming grace, and when they have gathered up the heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land where We cause rain to fall, bringing out all kinds of crops, just as We shall bring out the dead. Will you not reflect? Vegetation comes out of good land in abundance, by the will of its Lord, but out of bad land only scantily: We explain Our Revelations in various ways to those who give thanks.\n\n[Chapter 7, Verses 54-58]";

"CreationOfTheUniverse" = "Creation Of The Universe";
"CreationOfTheUniverse_Text" = "Are the disbelievers not aware that the heavens and the earth were once fused together in a single piece, and then We split them apart? We made every living thing from water? So won’t they believe? And We put firm mountains on the earth, lest it should sway under them, and set broad paths on it, so that they might follow the right direction, and We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away. It is He who created night and day, the sun and the moon, each floating in its orbit. We have not granted everlasting life to any other human being before you either [O Muhammad] – if you die, will [the disbelievers] live for ever? Every soul is certain to taste death: We test you all through the bad and the good, and to Us you will all return.\n\n[Chapter 21, Verses 30-35]";

"TheShadow" = "The Shadow";
"TheShadow_Text" = "Do you not see how your Lord lengthens the shadow? If He had willed, He could have made it stand still – We made the sun its indicator – but We gradually draw it towards Us, little by little.\n\n[Chapter 25, Verses 45-46]";

"Observation" = "Observation";
"Observation_Text" = "Do the disbelievers not see how rain clouds are formed, how the heavens are lifted, how the mountains are raised high, how the earth is spread out? So remind, [O Muhammad]; you are only a reminder. You are not over them a controller.\n\n[Chapter 88, Verses 17-22]";

"UsingReason" = "Using Reason";
"UsingReason_Text" = "This Book is sent down from God, the Mighty, the Wise. There are signs in the heavens and the earth for those who believe: in the creation of you, in the creatures God scattered on earth, there are signs for people of sure faith; in the alternation of night and day, in the rain God provides, sending it down from the sky and reviving the dead earth with it, and in His shifting of the winds there are signs for those who use their reason. These are God’s signs that We recount to you [O Muhammad, to show] the Truth. If they deny God and His revelations, what message will they believe in?\n\n[Chapter 45, Verses 2-6]";

"Disgrace" = "Disgrace";
"Disgrace_Text" = "Had your Lord willed, all the people on earth would have believed. So can you [O Muhammad] compel people to believe? No soul can believe except by God’s will, and He brings disgrace on those who do not use their reason. Say, \"Observe what is in the heavens and earth.\" But of no avail will be signs or warners to a people who do not believe. So do they wait except for like [what occurred in] the days of those who passed on before them? Say, \"Then wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait.\"\n\n[Chapter 10, Verses 99-102]";

"GodsOneness" = "God's Oneness";
"GodsOneness_Text" = "Say, Praise be to God and peace on the servants He has chosen. Who is better: God, or those they set up as partners with Him? Who created the heavens and earth? Who sends down water from the sky for you – with which We cause gardens of delight to grow: you have no power to make the trees grow in them – is it another god beside God? No! But they are people who take others to be equal with God. Who is it that made the earth a stable place to live? Who made rivers flow through it? Who set immovable mountains on it and created a barrier between the fresh and salt water? Is it another god beside God? No! But most of them do not know. Who is it that answers the distressed when they call upon Him? Who removes their suffering? Who makes you successors in the earth? Is it another god beside God? Little notice you take! Who is it that guides you through the darkness on land and sea? Who sends the winds as heralds of good news before His mercy? Is it another god beside God? God is far above the partners they put beside him! Who is it that creates life and reproduces it? Who is it that gives you provision from the heavens and earth? Is it another god beside God?’ Say, 'Show me your evidence then, if what you say is true.' Say, 'No one in the heavens or on earth knows the unseen except God.' They do not know when they will be raised from the dead: their knowledge cannot comprehend the Hereafter; they are in doubt about it; they are blind to it. So the disbelievers say, 'What! When we and our forefathers have become dust, shall we be brought back to life again? We have heard such promises before, and so did our forefathers. These are just ancient fables.'\n\n[Chapter 27, Verses 59-68]";

"GodsNames" = "God's Names";
"GodsNames_Text" = "If We had sent this Quran down to a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and split apart in its awe of God: We offer people such illustrations so that they may reflect. He is God: there is no god other than Him. It is He who knows what is hidden as well as what is in the open, He is the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy. He is God: there is no god other than Him, the Controller, the Holy One, Source of Peace, Granter of Security, Guardian over all, the Almighty, the Compeller, the Truly Great; God is far above anything they consider to be His partner. He is God: the Creator, the Originator, the Shaper. The best names belong to Him. Everything in the heavens and earth glorifies Him: He is the Almighty, the Wise.\n\n[Chapter 59, Verses 21-24]";

"Light" = "Light";
"Light_Text" = "God is the Light of the heavens and earth. His Light is like this: there is a niche, and in it a lamp, the lamp inside a glass, a glass like a glittering star, fueled from a blessed olive tree from neither east nor west, whose oil almost gives light even when no fire touches it – light upon light – God guides whoever He will to his Light; God draws such comparisons for humankind; God has full knowledge of everything.\n\n[Chapter 24, Verses 35]";

"WhenInNeed" = "When In Need";
"WhenInNeed_Text" = "Everything in the heavens and earth belongs to God. God is self-sufficient and worthy of all praise. If all the trees on earth were pens and all the seas, with seven more seas besides, [were ink,] still God’s words would not run out: God is Almighty and All Wise. Creating and resurrecting all of you is only like creating or resurrecting a single soul: God is All Hearing and all Seeing. Do you not see that God causes the night to merge into day and the day to merge into night; that He has subjected the sun and the moon, each to run its course for a stated term; that He is aware of everything you [people] do? This is because God is the Truth, and what they invoke beside Him is false. He is the Most High, Most Great. Do you not see that ships sail through the sea, by the grace of God, to show you [people] some of His wonders? Truly there are signs in this for every steadfast, thankful person. When the waves loom over those on board like giant shadows they call out to God, devoting their religion entirely to Him. But, when He has delivered them safely to land, some of them waver – only a treacherous, thankless person refuses to acknowledge Our signs. O Humankind, be mindful of your Lord and fear a day when no parent will take the place of their child, nor a child take the place of their parent, in any way. God’s promise is true, so do not let the present life delude you, nor let the deceiver delude you about God.\n\n[Chapter 31, Verses 26-33]";

"GodsKnowledge" = "God's Knowledge";
"GodsKnowledge_Text" = "He has the keys to the unseen: no one knows them but Him. He knows all that is in the land and sea. No leaf falls without His knowledge, nor is there a single grain in the darkness of the earth, or anything, fresh or withered, that is not written in a clear Record. It is He who calls your souls back by night, knowing what you have done by day, then raises you up again in the daytime until your fixed term is fulfilled. It is to Him that you will return in the end, and He will tell you what you have done. He is the Supreme Master over His subjects. He sends out recorders to watch over you until, when death overtakes any of you, those sent by Us take his soul – they never fail in their duty. Then they will all be returned to God, their true Lord. The Judgement truly belongs to Him, and He is the swiftest of reckoners. Say [O Muhammad], 'Who is it that saves you from the dark depths of land and sea when you humbly and secretly call to Him [and say], \"If He rescues us from this, We shall truly be thankful\"' Say,‘God rescues you from this and every distress; yet still you worship others beside Him.’\n\n[Chapter 6, Verses 59-64]";

"TheCreatorOfColour" = "The Creator Of Colour";
"TheCreatorOfColour_Text" = "Have you not considered how God sends water down from the sky and that We produce with it fruits of varied colours; that there are in the mountains layers of white and red of various hues, and jet black; that there are various colours among human beings, wild animals, and livestock too? It is those of His servants who have knowledge who stand in true awe of God. God is Almighty, Most Forgiving. Those who recite God’s scripture, keep up the prayer, give secretly and openly from what We have provided for them, may hope for a trade that will never decline: He will repay them in full, and give them extra from His bounty. He is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative.\n\n[Chapter 35, Verses 27-30]";

"Favours" = "Favours";
"Favours_Text" = "[He is] Lord of the two sunrises and Lord of the two sunsets. So which of the favours of your Lord would you deny? He released the two seas, meeting [side by side]; between them is a barrier [so] neither of them transgresses. So which of the favours of your Lord would you deny? From both of them emerge pearl and coral. So which of the favours of your Lord would you deny? And to Him belong the ships [with sails] elevated in the sea like mountains. So which of the favours of your Lord would you deny? Everyone upon the earth will perish, and there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honour. So which of the favours of your Lord would you deny? Whoever is within the heavens and earth asks Him; every day He is bringing about a matter. So which of the favours of your Lord would you deny? We will attend to you, O prominent beings. So which of the favours of your Lord would you deny? O company of jinn and humankind, if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass. You will not pass except by authority [from God]. So which of the favours of your Lord would you deny?\n\n[Chapter 55, Verses 17-34]";

"Gratitude" = "Gratitude";
"Gratitude_Text" = "He creates you in your mothers wombs, in one stage after another, in threefold depths of darkness. Such is God, your Lord; He holds control, there is no god but Him. How can you turn away? If you are ungrateful, remember God has no need of you, yet He is not pleased by ingratitude in His servants; if you are grateful, He is pleased [to see] it in you. No soul will bear another’s burden. You will return to your Lord in the end and He will inform you of what you have done: He knows well what is in the depths of [your] hearts.\n\n[Chapter 39, Verses 6-7]";

"FriendsOfGod" = "Friends Of God";
"FriendsOfGod_Text" = "In whatever matter you may be engaged and whatever part of the Quran you are reciting, whatever work you are doing, We witness you when you are engaged in it. Not even the weight of a speck of dust in the earth or sky escapes your Lord, nor anything lesser or greater: it is all written in a clear record. But for those who are on God’s side there is no fear, nor shall they grieve. For those who believe and are conscious of God, for them there is good news in this life and in the Hereafter – there is no changing the promises of God – that is truly the supreme triumph.\n\n[Chapter 10, Verses 61-64]";

"Conviction" = "Conviction";
"Conviction_Text" = "We shall show them Our signs in every region of the earth and in themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that your Lord witnesses everything? Truly, they doubt that they will meet their Lord; truly He encompasses everything.\n\n[Chapter 41, Verses 53-54]";

"Contentment" = "Contentment";
"Contentment_Text" = "So [Humankind] respond to your Lord before there comes a Day that cannot, against God’s will, be averted – you will have no refuge on that Day, and no possibility of denying [your sins]. If they still turn away [remember that] We have not sent you [O Muhammad] to be their guardian: your only duty is to deliver the message. And when We let the human being taste mercy from Us, he becomes happy with it, and when adversity afflicts them because of what their hands have done, the human being becomes ungrateful. God has control of the heavens and the earth; He creates whatever He will – He grants female offspring to whoever He will, male to whoever He will, or both male and female, and He makes whoever He will barren: He is All Knowing and All Powerful. It is not granted to any mortal that God should speak to him except through revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal by His command what He will: He is Exalted and Wise.\n\n[Chapter 42, Verses 47-51]";

"SeeingGod" = "Seeing God";
"SeeingGod_Text" = "Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, \"Be,\" and it is. Those who do not know say, \"Why does God not speak to us or there come to us a sign?\" Thus spoke those before them like their words. Their hearts resemble each other. We have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain [in faith].\n\n[Chapter 2, Verses 117-118]";

"Islam" = "Islam";
"Islam_Text" = "Say, [O Muhammad], \"O people, if you are in doubt as to my religion - then I do not worship those which you worship besides God; but I worship God, who causes your death. And I have been commanded to be of the believers\" and [commanded], direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth, and never be of those who associate others with God; and do not invoke besides God that which neither benefits you nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers. And if God should touch you with adversity, there is no remover of it except Him; and if He intends for you good, then there is no repeller of His bounty. He causes it to reach whom He wills of His servants. And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Say [O Muhammad], \"O People, the truth has come to you from your Lord, so whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul, and whoever goes astray only goes astray [in violation] against it. And I am not over you a manager.\" And follow what is revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and be patient until God will judge. And He is the best of judges.\n\n[Chapter 10, Verses 104-109]";

"Worship" = "Worship";
"Worship_Text" = "Every previous people to whom a messenger was sent also said, \"A sorcerer, or maybe a madman!\" Did they tell one another to do this? No! They are a people who exceed all bounds so ignore them [O Muhammad]– you are not to blame – and go on reminding [people], it is good for those who believe to be reminded. I created jinn and humankind only to worship Me.\n\n[Chapter 51, Verses 52-56]";

"Kinship" = "Kinship";
"Kinship_Text" = "It is He who released the two bodies of flowing water, one sweet and fresh and the other salty and bitter, and put an insurmountable barrier between them. It is He who creates human beings from fluid, then makes them kin by blood and marriage: your Lord is All Powerful! Yet instead of God they worship things that can neither benefit nor harm them....\n\n[Chapter 25, Verses 53-55]";

"Disbelievers" = "Disbelievers";
"Disbelievers_Text" = "Say [O Muhammad], \"Disbelievers: I do not worship what you worship, you do not worship what I worship, I will never worship what you worship, you will never worship what I worship: you have your religion and I have mine.\"\n\n[Chapter 109, Verses 1-6]";

"Muhammad" = "Muhammad";
"Muhammad_Text" = "Say [O Muhammad], \"I am only a human being, like you, to whom it has been revealed that your God is One. Anyone who fears to meet his Lord should do good deeds and give no one a share in the worship due to his Lord.\"\n\n[Chapter 18, Verses 110]";

"NaturalReligion" = "Natural Religion";
"NaturalReligion_Text" = "So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. This is the natural disposition God instilled in humankind – there is no altering God’s creation – and this is the right religion, though most people do not realize it. Turn to Him alone, all of you. Be mindful of Him; keep up the prayer; do not join those who ascribe partners to God.\n\n[Chapter 30, Verses 30-31]";

"SteepRoad" = "Steep Road";
"SteepRoad_Text" = "I swear by this land, and you’re a legal resident of this land, and I swear by the bond between a parent and a child - and so it was that We created human beings to labour on in toil and hardship. Does he think there’s no power over him, and while he may boast, ‘I have wealth to waste!’ does he think no one’s watching him? Haven’t We given him a pair of eyes, a tongue and a pair of lips and then shown him the two roads (of good and evil)? Yet, he makes no effort to travel the steep road, and how can you understand what the steep road is? It is to free a slave, to feed at a time of hunger an orphaned relative or a poor person in distress, and to be one of those who believe and urge one another to steadfastness and compassion.\n\n[Chapter 90, Verses 1-17]";

"EaseAndHardship" = "Ease And Hardship";
"EaseAndHardship_Text" = "By the night when it covers, by the radiant day, by His creation of male and female! Truly, varied are the goals (for which you strive). There is the one who gives, who is mindful of God, who testifies to goodness, We shall smooth his way towards ease. There is the one who is miserly, who is self-satisfied, who denies goodness. We shall smooth his way towards hardship and his wealth will not help him as he falls. Our part is to provide guidance, this world and the next belong to Us.\n\n[Chapter 92, Verses 1-13]";

"CommonKindness" = "Common Kindness";
"CommonKindness_Text" = "[Muhammad], have you considered the person who denies the Judgement? It is he who pushes aside the orphan and does not urge others to feed the needy. So woe to those who pray but are heedless of their prayer; those who are all show and forbid common kindnesses\n\n[Chapter 107, Verses 1-7]";

"TheGardeners" = "The Gardeners";
"TheGardeners_Text" = "We have tried them as We tried the owners of a certain garden, who swore that they would harvest its fruits in the morning and made no allowance [for the Will of God]: a disaster from your Lord struck the garden as they slept and by morning it was stripped bare, a desolate land. Still they called each other at daybreak, \"Go early to your field if you wish to gather all its fruits,\" and went off, whispering, \"Make sure no poor person enters the garden today!\"– they left early, bent on their purpose – but when they saw the garden, they said, \"We must have lost our way! No we are ruined!\" The wisest of them said, \"Did I not say to you, 'Will you not glorify God?\"'– they said, \"Glory be to God, Our Lord! Truly, we were doing wrong!\" – and then they turned to each other in mutual reproach. They said, \"Alas for us! We have done terrible wrong, but maybe our Lord will give us something better in its place: we truly turn to Him in hope.\" Such is the punishment [in this life], but greater still is the punishment in the Hereafter, if only they knew. There will be Gardens of bliss for those who are mindful of God. Should We treat those who submit to Us as We treat those who do evil? What is the matter with you? On what basis do you judge?\n\n[Chapter 68, Verses 17-36]";

"Charity" = "Charity";
"Charity_Text" = "Whoever is given wisdom has truly been given much good, but only those with insight bear this in mind. Whatever you may give, or vow to give, God knows it well, and those who do wrong will have no one to help them. If you give charity openly, it is good, but if you keep it secret and give to the needy in private, that is better for you, and it will atone for some of your bad deeds: God is well aware of all that you do.\n\n[Chapter 2, Verses 269-271]";

"Sincerity" = "Sincerity";
"Sincerity_Text" = "You who believe, do not cancel out your charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful words, like someone who spends his wealth only to be seen by people, not believing in God and the Last Day. Such a person is like a rock with earth on it: heavy rain falls and leaves it completely bare. Such people get no rewards for their works: God does not guide the disbelievers. But those who spend their wealth in order to gain God’s approval, and as an affirmation of their own faith, are like a garden on a hill: heavy rain falls and it produces double its normal yield; even if no heavy rain falls, it will still be watered by the dew. God sees all that you do. Would any of you like to have a garden of palm trees and vines, graced with flowing streams and all kinds of produce, which, when you are afflicted with old age and feeble offspring, is struck by a fiery whirlwind and burnt down? In this way God makes His messages clear to you, so that you may reflect on them.\n\n[Chapter 2, Verses 264-266]";

"DivineLove" = "Divine Love";
"DivineLove_Text" = "Your God is the one God: there is no god except Him, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy.

Even so, there are some who choose to worship others besides God as rivals to Him, loving them with the love due to God, But those of faith are overflowing in their love for God….\n\n[Chapter 2, Verses 163-165]";

"UsingYourGifts" = "Using Your Gifts";
"UsingYourGifts_Text" = "It is God who endowed you with hearing, sight, and hearts – how seldom you are grateful. It is He who made you multiply on earth.

"DepressionAndSatisfaction" = "Depression And Satisfaction";
"DepressionAndSatisfaction_Text" = "And whoever turns away from My remembrance - indeed, he will have a depressed life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind. He will say, \"My Lord, why have you raised me blind while I was [once] seeing?\" [God] will say, \"Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot them; and thus will you this Day be forgotten.\" And thus do We recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more enduring. Then, has it not become clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings? Indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence. And if not for a word that preceded from your Lord, punishment would have been an obligation [due immediately], and [if not for] a specified term [decreed].

And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] the splendor of worldly life by which We test them.

It is God alone who gives what He will, abundantly or sparingly, to whichever He will of His creatures: if God had not been gracious to us, He would have caused the earth to swallow us too.\" Alas indeed! Those who deny the truth will never prosper.

The life of this world is like this: rain that We send down from the sky is absorbed by the plants of the earth, from which humans and animals eat.

But you [O Muhammad] can only warn those who fear their Lord, though they cannot see Him, and keep up the prayer – whoever purifies himself does so for his own benefit – everything returns to God. The blind and the seeing are not alike, nor are darkness and light; shade and heat are not alike, nor are the living and the dead. God makes anyone He wills hear [His message]: you cannot make those in their graves hear.

He sends hail down from [such] mountains in the sky, pouring it on whoever He wishes and diverting it from whoever He wishes – the flash of its lightning almost snatches sight away. God alternates night and day – there truly is a lesson in [all] this for those who have eyes to see – and God created each animal out of [its own] fluid: some of them crawl on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some on four.

Today’s wrongdoers will also suffer the evil effects of their deeds: they will not escape. Do they not know that God provides abundantly for anyone He will and gives sparingly to anyone He will?
